# todo

- *Error message when generating people fails*
- Allow people to add tokens to rules before creating rule
- Add option to lock values before generating
- Instructions on how to share the link with others
- Instructions on how rules work, what everything means, etc.
- Sign into admin panel when creating group
- Account system (emails, participating groups, created groups, better password handling, duplicating groups, using other groups to form rules in new group, etc.)
- Make text field in modals focus when the modal shows
- Rules autocomplete names and classes

More complicated things:

- Allow admins to create a form for participants to fill out in order to join, and allow rules to access the values of these inputs

And as always, issues on [github](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/Gift-Exchange-2/issues/)
