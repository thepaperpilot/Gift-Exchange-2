# todo

- *Error message when generating people fails*
- Allow people to add tokens to rules before creating rule
- If a participant can't find a recipient that matches all rules, it disregards all of them. Instead it should go down the list of rules and choose the last state it can where there is at least one valid recipient.
- Add option to lock values before generating
- More secure password handling
- Instructions on how to share the link with others
- Instructions on how rules work, what everything means, etc.
- Sign into admin panel when creating group

More complicated things:

- Allow admins to create a form for participants to fill out in order to join, and allow rules to access the values of these inputs

And as always, issues on [github](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/Gift-Exchange-2/issues/)
